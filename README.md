This project includes Python notebook that has the complete code to run the CRF. The notebook includes code to download/extract the data and trains the model.

* CRF-Khmer-Segmentation.ipynb: Implementation using CRF
* HMM_Khmer_Segmentaion.ipynb: Using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
* sklearn_Khmer_segmentation.ipynb: Naive Bayes and other sklearn algorithms 
(Random Forest and Linear Regression got to 93%, Naive Bayes is around 89%)

If you open this from Google Colab, you can run right away without any further setup.
